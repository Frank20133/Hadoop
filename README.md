- Adding the directory of `bin` to environmental variable `PATH`, then you can use any command inside `bin`. For example, you can 
  directly use `hdfs dfs -ls` while you are at `~` directory.
- Have been in Hadoop directory, we can use `bin/hdfs` to look up all the commands.
- Using `bin/hdfs dfs -ls` to skim all directories in HDFS.
